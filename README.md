# Hangman-game
 Hangman is a word guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. If the player guesses a correct letter, it is revealed in the word. If the player guesses an incorrect letter, a part of a hangman is drawn. The player loses if the hangman is completed before the player guesses the word.
